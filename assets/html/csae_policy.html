    <h1>Community Standards and Enforcement (CSAE)</h1>

    <p>At <strong>FindLove</strong>, we are committed to fostering a respectful and secure community. Our Community
        Standards are designed to ensure that all users enjoy a positive experience, free from harassment,
        discrimination, or abuse. These standards apply to all interactions and content shared on the platform.</p>

    <h2>Our Core Community Standards</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Respect and Inclusion:</strong> Treat all users with kindness and respect, regardless of their
            background, beliefs, or preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent and Boundaries:</strong> Always communicate with consent and respect others' boundaries.
            Unsolicited messages or inappropriate content is strictly prohibited.</li>
        <li><strong>No Hate or Violence:</strong> Content promoting hate speech, violence, racism, or discrimination
            will not be tolerated and may result in immediate account suspension.</li>
        <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Use your real identity and avoid creating fake or misleading profiles.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> Do not attempt to collect personal information such as financial data,
            passwords, or government IDs from other users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Enforcement</h2>
    <p>We use both automated tools and manual moderation to detect violations of our standards. When a violation is
        identified, the following actions may be taken based on the severity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Warning notice sent to the user.</li>
        <li>Temporary or permanent suspension of the user's account.</li>
        <li>Reporting to legal authorities if applicable (e.g., in cases of abuse or threats).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you witness or experience any behavior that violates our standards, please report it immediately using the
        in-app reporting tools or contact our support team at <a
            href="mailto:contact@sorravlstudios.in">contact@sorravlstudios.in</a>. Your safety is our top priority.</p>
